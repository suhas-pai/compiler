1. Type objects are always immutable
2. Function variables used in types/constraints must be const
3. Number types must always be provided (i.e. 0u32, 1.0f64), except only when the
   compiler can make a 100% guess, and except in integer ranges (i.e. 0..<10, 1..=20) where
   the compiler will infer the smallest integer type possible.
4. The inferred type for the object type in arrays is the type inferred for the first element.
5. The inferred type for the return value of a function w/o a specified return type is the type inferred from the earliest return statement.
