1. Type objects are always immutable
2. Function variables used in types/constraints must be const
3. The inferred type for the base type in arrays is the type inferred for the first element.
4. The inferred type for the return value of a function w/o a specified return type is the type inferred from the earliest return statement.
5. All function parameters can refer to each other, even those that haven't been declared "yet" (when reading left-to-right)
6. All top-level (global) can be referred to other top-level (global) decls that haven't been declared yet.
7. Function parameters without type information will be given implied constraints based on the function implementation.
8. Function values cannot be used as constraints, even if they don't qualify as constraints
